# TODO
* Need to think about having the balance sheets, income_statements, etc ordered. ??
* Handle API rate limiting. 
* Group companies based on sector. 
* Need to add error handling everywhere
* DRY up ratio calculations. 
* Error handle ratio calculations.
* Change the way the values are displayed. Right now all numbers are converted to millions but that
    is not how the original ratios spreadsheet shows it. They show "in millions" 
* Want to replace any .last commands with .newest. This will involve adding support for .newest
